**Rime** is a headless CMS built on top of **SvelteKit**, designed with a focus on flexibility, ease of configuration, user-friendly administration, and performance. It’s made for developers who want to concentrate on creativity rather than fighting with the tools.

## Why another CMS ?

The main goal of **Rime** is to provide instant access to a flexible admin panel, with all the essential tools to build your project, including:

- Built-in [i18n](/docs/03-04-configuration__i18n.md) support
- Version system
- A wide variety of [fields](/docs/04-fieds.md), including blocks and nested arrays
- A flexible, intuitive rich-text editor
- Headless architecture, so you can build your front-end without limitations
- Automatic API endpoint generation
- Great types supports, from your database schema to your front-end
- Smooth, developer-friendly workflow

While some existing tools offer similar features — with varying levels of configuration complexity — none of them truly met my needs without compromise. **Rime** bridges that gap, combining the full power of **SvelteKit** and **Svelte**, while providing all the features a CMS needs.
