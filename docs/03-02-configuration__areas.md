An area is a singleton document type, defined by its `slug`, its fields and some properties. Based on those, API endpoints, types, and panel related pages are generated. Here is an example area :

```ts
import { Area } from '$rime/config';
import { text, toggle } from '@bienbien/rime/fields';

const Settings = Area.create('settings', {
  fields: [
    text('siteTitle').required(),
    toggle('maintenance')
  ]
});
```

The slug, passed as the first argument of `Area.create` must be unique across all of your documents.
