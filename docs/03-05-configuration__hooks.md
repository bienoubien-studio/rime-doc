# Hooks

Rime provides various hooks that allow you to control operations throughout your application. Here's how you create a basic hook:

```ts
const pagesBeforeUpdate = Hooks.beforeUpdate<'pages'>(args => {
  if(args.params.id === 'some-id'){
    args.data.title = 'OMG a mutation'
  }
  return args
})
```

Hooks receive an object as their argument containing the following properties:

| Property            | Description                                                                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| event               | The current SvelteKit RequestEvent                                                   |
| context             | The operation context [learn more](#operation-context)                               |
| config              | The document configuration                                                           |
| operation           | The operation type: `create`, `read`, `update`, or `delete`                          |
| data                | The data being processed (only available for `update` and `create` operations)       |
| doc                 | The existing document before the operation (not available for `create` operations)   |

## beforeOperation

The `beforeOperation` hook is a special hook that's shared by both collections and areas. It triggers before any operation runs, right after the document access control check passes.

```ts
import { Collection, Hooks } from '$rime/config';

const Posts = Collection.create('posts', {
  //...
  $hooks: {
    beforeOperation: [
      Hooks.beforeOperation(async (args) => {
        const { event } = args
        event.locals.brew = new Brew()
        return { ...args, event }
      })
    ]
  }
});
```

The `beforeOperation` hook receives an object with these properties:

| Property            | Description                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| event               | The current SvelteKit RequestEvent                          |
| context             | The operation context ([learn more](#operation-context))    |
| config              | The document configuration                                  |
| operation           | The operation type: `create`, `read`, `update`, or `delete` |

## Area Hooks

Areas support these specific hooks: `beforeRead`, `beforeUpdate`, and `afterUpdate`:

```ts
import { Area } from '$rime/config';

const Settings = Area.create('settings', {
  //...
  $hooks: {
    beforeRead: [ /** */ ],
    beforeUpdate: [ /** */ ],
    afterUpdate: [ /** */ ],
  }
});
```

## Collection Hooks

Collections support a comprehensive set of hooks: `beforeOperation`, `beforeCreate`, `beforeRead`, `beforeUpdate`, `beforeDelete`, `afterCreate`, `afterUpdate`, and `afterDelete`:

```ts
import { Collection, Hooks } from '$rime/config';

const Posts = Collection.create('posts', {
  //...
  $hooks: {
    beforeOperation: [ /** */ ],
    beforeCreate: [ /** */ ],
    beforeRead: [ /** */ ],
    beforeUpdate: [ /** */ ],
    beforeDelete: [ /** */ ],
    afterCreate: [ /** */ ],
    afterUpdate: [ /** */ ],
    afterDelete: [ /** */ ],
  }
});
```

## Operation Context

The operation context is provided as part of each hook's arguments. It's an object that contains:

| Property            | Description                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| params              | All parameters that were passed to the original operation method  |
| versionOperation    | The type of version operation being performed                     |
| originalDoc         | The original document (only available during `update` operations) |
| isSystemOperation   | Indicates whether the operation was triggered by the system       |
| isFallbackLocale    | Indicates whether this is a localized fallback update operation   |
